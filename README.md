# *AutomatingSQLite3CRUD*

### *Summary:*
*In this project, I integrated SQLite3 database operations with Python to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. SQLite is a lightweight and reliable database engine, and by using the sqlite3 module in Python, we can easily work with SQLite databases. I created tables, inserted data, retrieved information using SQL queries, updated records, and deleted data from the database.*

### *Conclusion:*
*Integrating SQLite3 with Python provides a convenient way to work with relational databases. SQLite is a self-contained, serverless database engine that offers excellent performance. By performing CRUD operations, we demonstrated the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete data from an SQLite database using Python. This integration is useful for various applications, enabling efficient data management and manipulation.*
